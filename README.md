# Next.js Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Next.js documentation! Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables efficient and scalable web application development. This documentation will guide you through the fundamentals of Next.js, covering topics such as project setup, routing, layout structuring, and more.

## Getting Started

To start developing with Next.js, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install Next.js by running the following command in your terminal:

2. **Project Setup**: Create a new Next.js project by running:

3. **Development Server**: Start the development server by navigating into your project directory and running:

This command will launch the Next.js development server, allowing you to preview your application locally.

## Flow

### Running Development Server

During development, execute the following command to start the Next.js development server:

This command internally invokes `next dev`, which sets up a development environment for your Next.js application.

### Layout Structure

In Next.js, the layout structure plays a crucial role in organizing your application components. Typically, you'll define a layout component, such as `layout.tsx`, which encapsulates the common UI elements shared across multiple pages.

## Page Components

Each page in your Next.js application is represented by a React component. These components are typically stored in the `pages` directory and follow a specific naming convention for routing purposes.

## Routing

### File-Based Routing

Next.js follows a file-based routing system, where the route path corresponds to the file structure within the `pages` directory. By default, Next.js provides a 404 Not Found page.

### Nested Routing

To implement nested routing in Next.js, you can create subfolders within the `pages` directory. Each subfolder should contain its own `page.tsx` file, representing a nested route.

### Dynamic Routing

Next.js allows for dynamic routing by using brackets `[]` in the filename within the `pages` directory. This enables you to create dynamic routes based on parameters passed in the URL.

For example, to create a dynamic route for `/users/[id]`, you would create a file named `[id].tsx` within the `pages/users` directory.

#### Getting Route Parameters

When using dynamic routing in Next.js, the route parameters are passed as props to your page component. To access the route parameters, you can destructure them from the `params` object.

```tsx
export default function ProductDetails({
  params,
}: {
  params: {
    productId: string;
  };
}) {
  return <>Details about product {params.productId}</>;
}
```

// pages/products/[productId]/reviews/[reviewId].tsx

### Nested Dynamic Routing

To implement nested dynamic routing, we can create a folder under the `productId` directory. Within this folder, we can create another folder for dynamic routes. Inside this nested folder, we'll place a `page.tsx` file. This structure enables us to extract both the product ID and review ID.

Such organization enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier to manage dynamic routes and retrieve necessary parameters.

```tsx
export default function Reviewdetails({
  params,
}: {
  params: {
    productId: string;
    reviewId: string;
  };
}) {
  return (
    <>
      details about review {params.reviewId} of product {params.productId}..
    </>
  );
}
```

### Catch-All Segments

Catch-all segments in Next.js routing are denoted by placing three dots (`...`) before a segment in a dynamic route, like `/pages/[...slug].tsx`.

- **Dynamic Matching**: Catch-all segments can match any number of segments in the URL path, offering flexibility in handling routes with variable structures.

- **Accessing Parameters**: In the corresponding page component, you can access the catch-all segment as `params.slug`, which will be an array containing the matched segments.

- **Fallback Behavior**: Catch-all routes can have fallback behavior, determining how Next.js handles unmatched paths. You can specify whether to statically generate pages for known paths, handle paths dynamically at runtime, or return a 404 error for unknown paths.

- **Use Cases**: Catch-all segments are useful for handling nested categories, user-generated content, or any scenario where the structure of the path may vary.

- **Dynamic API Routes**: Catch-all segments can also be used in API routes (`/pages/api/[...slug].ts`), enabling dynamic handling of API endpoints based on varying URL paths.

- **Performance Considerations**: When using catch-all routes with fallback behavior set to `true`, consider the potential impact on performance. Pre-generating static pages or implementing caching mechanisms can help mitigate performance issues.

```tsx
export default function Docs({
  params,
}: {
  params: {
    slug: string[];
  };
}) {
  if (params.slug?.length === 2) {
    return (
      <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl">
        Docs Home page for {params.slug[0]} and concept {params.slug[1]}
      </h1>
    );
  } else if (params.slug?.length === 1) {
    return (
      <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl">
        Docs Home page for features {params.slug[0]}
      </h1>
    );
  }
  return <h1>Docs Home page</h1>;
}
```
